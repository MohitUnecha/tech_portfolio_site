            <p>When I listen to this song, it feels like late nights at the airport with my headphones in, watching the world rush around me while I move in slow motion. I love traveling, not just for the places I go but for the in-between moments when I am no longer at home but not quite where I am headed. <em>“Flight’s booked, reservations made for you”</em> always feels like it is speaking directly to me, reminding me that distance can teach lessons closeness never could.</p>
            <p>I first played this on repeat while packing for a trip, shoving clothes into a bag, and realizing how much of myself I was leaving behind. Now every time I hear it, I connect it to that bittersweet mix of leaving what is safe in order to chase something bigger. The calm melody carries a quiet confidence, a reminder that moving forward, even when I do not have all the answers, is its own kind of strength. Drake has always been my favorite artist, and this track is one of the reasons why. He has a way of saying the things I feel but struggle to put into words.</p>

          <!-- 2) Bad Bunny -->

            <h2>2) DTMF — Bad Bunny</h2>

            <p>This track hit me harder than I expected. When Bad Bunny sings <em>“Debí tirar más fotos”</em> (“I should have taken more photos”), I don’t just hear pictures; I hear every small chance I missed to hold on to a memory. I am the kind of person who clings to the past, and sometimes that makes me forget to pause and take in the present.</p>
            <p>The song feels like flipping through an album with too many blank pages. I think about my childhood, moving from place to place during elementary and middle school, and how I never took enough photos of my friends. Over time, those faces faded, and with them pieces of my imagination about what those friendships meant. The references to sunsets in Puerto Rico remind me that every place we leave behind takes something from us. For me, this song is a reminder to slow down, be present, and not be afraid to capture the moments that matter. One day, those fragments of joy may be all I have left to connect me to the people and places that shaped me.</p>

            <p>This track feels like freedom bottled into a song. The line <em>“I don’t know what you’ve been told, but time is running out, so spend it like it’s gold”</em> always stays with me because it reminds me to stop overthinking and just live. I often get caught up in life and forget to enjoy the simple moments, and this song pulls me back.</p>
            <p>I first heard it in <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>, and now I connect it to my own summer memories—laughing with friends, not checking the time, and not stressing about what comes next. For me, this song is about lightness and release, about putting down the weight of stress and remembering that joy matters too. Every time I replay it, it feels like a breath of fresh air, the kind of track that makes me want to roll down the windows, feel the wind, and let go. And honestly, it makes me feel a little like Tom Cruise in the movie—free, fearless, and unbothered.</p>

          <!-- 4) Noah Kahan -->

            <h2>4) Stick Season — Noah Kahan</h2>
            <video class="album-video right" width="300" height="169"
                   controls preload="metadata" playsinline
                   poster="assets/songs/Noah_Kahan_-_Stick_Season.png">

            </video>
            <p>This song feels like it was written for me and for anyone who lived through the hollow quiet of the pandemic. When Kahan sings, <em>“Doc told me to travel, but there’s COVID on the planes,”</em> I immediately go back to those months when escape was impossible. At the time, my family was moving, and we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, so quarantine felt less like safety and more like a prison.</p>
            <p>The song mirrors that sense of being stuck while the rest of the world moved forward. Lines like <em>“I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed”</em> cut deep because they show how quickly life leaves people behind. I feel that now, since most of my friends have gone back to their universities far away, I resonate with the emptiness of being left behind. What makes the song powerful is that it is not just about heartbreak; it is about loneliness that lingers even after the world has reopened. <em>“I hope this pain’s just passin’ through, but I doubt it”</em> stays with me most, because it captures the fear that some seasons of isolation leave marks that never fade.</p>

            <h2>5) Ghost — Justin Bieber</h2>
            <video class="album-video left" width="300" height="169"
                   controls preload="metadata" playsinline
                   poster="assets/songs/GHOST.jpg">
              <source src="assets/video/Ghost.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Sorry—your browser can’t play this video.
            </video>
            <p>This song makes me think about the future, not in a hopeful way, but in a way that fills me with fear. The line <em>“If I can’t be close to you, I’ll settle for the ghost of you”</em> feels heavy because it captures how loss stays long after someone is gone. Since 2020, I have lost a family member every year, and that has left me afraid of death, not just my own, but the emptiness that follows when someone you love is no longer there.</p>
            <p>This summer, I lost my dad’s brother, and that loss cut especially deep. I shaved my head in mourning, and every time I look in the mirror, I carry that reminder. What hurts even more is watching my family go through the pain, especially my dad. Two years ago, he lost his mother, and now his brother. He never shows his tears, but I know how much it breaks him. Seeing his strength and also knowing the grief he hides makes this song even more important to me. For me, <em>“Ghost”</em> is not just about missing someone; it is about holding onto them in the only way you can while continuing to live fully. It reminds me that chasing my dreams and succeeding is one way of honoring the ones I have lost. It is scary to know that loss is something everyone faces, but this song makes me feel less alone as I carry that weight.</p>
